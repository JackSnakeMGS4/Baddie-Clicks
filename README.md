# Baddie-Clicks
This is my attempt at making a game. I decided to leave a good chunk of my struggle as commented code on it so I could remind myself that despite it being bad it's progress.

The game begins once the player clicks Start Game!. After that, the player is given the instructions on how to defeat enemies. Enemies then attack at random locations and at a set time interval. Every time the player is successful in defeating an enemy the spawn rate decreases causing enemies to increase the frequency of their attacks. The game ends whenever the player is overrun by a set amount of enemies.

Would like to:

-Implement a database for keeping track of player's scores and show the player their highscore along with previous scores.

-Implement different levels which will scale to the player's abilities based upon the previous games played.

-Change the endgame scenario to be based off a time limit rather than a certain amount of enemies.

-Give the player a choice of time limits within reason.

-Change the platform to a mobile platform.

-Implement error handling.
